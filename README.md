# Prediction-and-Visualization-of-Ambient-Air-Quality-using-deep-learning-models


This is an AI project where air quality data is collected form kaggle. Different models like (FCNN, Bi-directional LSTM) are trained and visualized to determine what factors are playing a major role in depleting the air quality.
